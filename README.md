Analytics Cloud Native ML DL AWS Azure GCP Advanced Machine Learning on Google Cloud

Here we focus on advanced machine learning using Google Cloud Platform where we will get hands-on experience optimizing, deploying, and scaling production ML models of various types in hands-on labs. 
This teaches us how to build scalable, accurate, and production-ready models for structured data, image data, time-series, and natural language text. It ends with building recommendation systems.
