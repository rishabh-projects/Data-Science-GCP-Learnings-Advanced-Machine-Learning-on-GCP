### About
##### Analytics Cloud Native ML DL AWS Azure GCP Advanced Machine Learning on Google Cloud
##### Here we focus on advanced machine learning using Google Cloud Platform where we will get hands-on experience optimizing, deploying, and scaling production ML models of various types in hands-on labs. 
##### This teaches us how to build scalable, accurate, and production-ready models for structured data, image data, time-series, and natural language text. It ends with building recommendation systems.

### Here we will do End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform. Then we learn about the components and best practices of a high-performing ML system in production environments.
